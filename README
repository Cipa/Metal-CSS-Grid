# METAL - CSS Grid
## Responsive CSS Grid for building fast responsive websites 

See the website: http://cipalabs.com/projects/metal/

Metal Grid is another responsive CSS grid that hopes to be easy to use and hopefully grow with help from the community.

It uses a 12 grid system and adds support for a 5 column grid. Unequal columns are morphed by default and the user can easily updated how each of these columns change shape.

It is my intention to use this grid for building responsive sites really fast. For now the grid.css is under ~6Kb uncompressed.

If you want a semantically correct grid please take this code and change it to your needs.
