# METAL - CSS Grid
## Responsive CSS Grid for building fast responsive websites 

See the website: http://cipalabs.com/projects/metal/

Metal Grid is another responsive CSS grid that hopes to be easy to use and hopefully grow with help from the community.

It is my intention to use this grid for building responsive sites really fast. For now the grid.css is under ~5Kb uncompressed.

Unfortunately there is no way(that I know) to build a semantically correct grid so please take the code and use to build your own CSS structure.
